        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Kategna is a traditional Ethiopian dish that is simple yet 
            full of vibrant flavors. A delightful appetizer or midday 
            snack, Kategna is made with Injera - a sourdough-risen 
            flatbread with a unique, slightly spongy texture, typically 
            made out of fermented teff flour. This dish is loved for 
            its spicy kick brought by Berbere spice, a bold Ethiopian 
            spice mix featuring chili peppers, garlic, ginger, and 
            an array of other spices, paired with the luscious 
            texture of Kibe - Ethiopian clarified butter with a 
            distinct taste imparted by herbs and spices used in its 
            preparation. Served warm and fresh right off the Mitad 
            (traditional Ethiopian stove), Kategnaâ€™s exquisite taste 
            makes it a beloved addition to any Ethiopian meal. 
            The harmony of spicy Berbere and rich Kibe is beautifully 
            absorbed by the Injera, which is then toasted to create 
            a delightful crunch. While the recipe is simple, the 
            magic truly lies in the careful balance of these ingredients 
            and the freshness of the Injera.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Injera</li>
            <li>Berbere Spice</li>
            <li>Niter Kibe (Traditional Clarified Butter</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by melting the Kibe in a pan over medium heat. 
                Be careful to turn off the heat immediately after it 
                has melted, as Kibe can burn easily, altering its flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the Kibe is fully melted, add the Berbere spice and 
                a pinch of salt to the pan. Stir the mixture gently to 
                combine the spice and butter, forming a paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the Injera on the pan and bake it over low heat 
                for a couple of minutes until it's slightly dryer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the Injera is perfectly toasted, remove it from 
                the heat and spread the mixture all over the Injera, 
                ensuring that it is evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your Kategna is now ready to serve! It can be served 
                as a whole or rolled and cut into round pieces. 
                Regardless of how you choose to present it, the warm, 
                spicy, and buttery Kategna offers the same exquisite taste.
