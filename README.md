# odin-recipes
This is supposed to be my first project.
It will have an index page that will link to other pages with recipes
It's basically a brutalist website lol
By the end of this project I will have refined my HTML skills and also
my git skills.
I'm feeling fairly confident about the HTML part but I don't think I 
remember git very well.
