        <p>
            This website contains the recipes to three of my favorite
            Ethiopian dishes: Tibs, Kitfo, and Kategna. The first two
            are meat-based while the last one is made from injera, a 
            traditional sour flatbread from Ethiopia. I copied the 
            recipes from other websites, but I hope whoever comes across
            my website can prepare and enjoy these great dishes!
